Android SRCP client

I control my model railroad with the Simple Railroad Protocol. This client runs nicely on tablets.
Construct your layout, control switches and trains.
Tested with the SRCPd server on a Raspberry Pi.

This app is currently Beta and thus not available on Google Play.

Source code is under LGPL. Use Android Studio 2.1 to build.

If you would like to have the APK without building it for yourself, contact me.

I cannot be made responsible for any damage the app could do to your railroad.
