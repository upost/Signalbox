Signalbox

Android SRCP client

I control my model railroad with the Simple Railroad Protocol. This client runs nicely on tablets.
Construct your layout, control switches and trains.
Tested with the SRCPd server on a Raspberry Pi.

This app is currently Beta and thus not available on Google Play.

I cannot be made responsible for any damage the app could do to your railroad.
